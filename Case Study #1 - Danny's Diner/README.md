## Question and Solution

I have tried executing the queries using PostgreSQL on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138). 


**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC; 
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

***

***2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
¬†¬†customer_id,
¬†¬†COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)** to count the unique number of visits per customer.
- Use the **DISTINCT** to avoid duplicate counting of days.
